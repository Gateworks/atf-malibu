OcteonTX2 RAS implementation
============================

OcteonTX2 implements the ARMv8 RAS (Reliability, Availability & Serviceability)
specification.

This decouples the tracking of hardware exception events from any outage to
the data being transferred, allowing a RAS-aware OS (such as Linux 4.18 onward)
to handle the outage as it sees fit, by analysing the context in which the data
is being used.

Errors in memory/cache transactions are detected by the hardware and handled
by the firmware.  These can be correctable (CE), uncorrectable unrecoverable (UEU) or
uncorrectable recoverable (UER errors and result in a system notification.
  CE error is single bit ECC error in memory or cache.
  UEU error is double bit ECC error in secure memory region.
  UER error is double bit ECC error in non-secure memory region.

Note: Only MDC uncorrected errors(UE) are categorized by firmware as Uncorrected
Unrecoverable(UEU) and Uncorrected Recoverable(UER) based on secure/non-secure
attribute of the error address. Uncorrected errors from all other modules are
treated as fatal in the current firmware implementation.

The uncorrected errors are recorded and are made available to Linux upon subsequent
boot (via the Boot Error Record Table - BERT).

The firmware enables exceptions in relevant OcteonTX2 hardware units
(MDC, MCC, LMC) and performs the following actions:

- reports errors to serial console
- logs errors to a standard error-logging framework which is understood by
  RAS-aware OS software

The error-logging framework consists of:
  Generic Hardware Error Source (GHES)
  Hardware Error Source Table (HEST)
  Boot Error Record Table (BERT)

  Please refer to the ACPI specification for details of these.

The access procedure for GHES is well defined in a UEFI/ACPI platform,
also OcteonTX2 embedded deployments will use ATF & DeviceTree rather than ACPI.

Custom platform device in linux is provided to derive the GHES location
from device tree, and forward CPER records, so the error indications flow to the
standard processing of a kernel built with **MEMORY_FAILURE=y** option, which is
notified in the standard fashion with an SDEI, and acts to contain uncorrectable
errors, retire troublesome pages, and abort/restart impacted subsystems.

The full RAS model is not available in kernels before 4.18, so in this case the
error indications are passed to the processing of the legacy EDAC model.

For details of the Device Tree "sdei-ghes" node describing this shared-memory
communication area, see the following kernel document:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/edac/marvell-sdei-ghes.txt

To assist in verifying this reporting path, and any customer-developed code
which continues the processing from the details provided by standard RAS & EDAC
kernel interfaces, a set of SMC services is defined between kernels and ATF to
force error injection via the LMC/MCC/MDC memory/cache interfaces, to model the
response to a genuine outage.
The API details of this OCTEONTX_EDAC SMC are outlined in ATF's
  include/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx2/plat_ras.h

The ability to inject multi-bit errors compromises system integrity, so is
disabled in the regular DEBUG=0 ATF builds.

Device Tree sdei-ghes implementation notes
==========================================
ATF and Linux share a common memory block (ring buffer) several CPER format
error entries can fit into ring buffer (currently 4 records). In current
firmware first mode error identification interrupt (MDC/MCC/LMC) is delivered
to ATF. ATF writes error record into ring buffer head and triggers SDEI
event callback. SDEI callback Linux registered at boot time beforehand.
sdei-ghes callback move error record from ring buffer tail into Error Status
Block (estatus) memory area, ESB block allocated for one error entry for HEST.
Generic GHES driver makes periodic polling on Error Status Block and if ESB
contains error data handler provide error presence notification and error clear.
BERT Error Status Block size should correspond to ring buffer size to fit all BED
Boot Error Data.

ACPI sdei-ghes implementation notes
===================================
Setup Linux bootarg acpi=on.
GHES requires Sdei.asl table to enable SDEI events. Hest.asl describe
corresponding table layout and initialization values like polling
interval, Error Status Block address (8byte), actual Error Status Block, and
Ring buffer memory block. Bert.asl describe memory region for ring buffer and
ESB memory area which fits all errors from ring to notify at boot time.
